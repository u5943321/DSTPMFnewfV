“Axiomatizing a category of categories”, a categorical foundation by Colin McLarty.

Original statements of the theorems are from [McLarty's original paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2275472).

- `CCAFsetting`: Theorem 1-17, except for Theorem 13.
- `adj`: About adjunction (Theorem 13).
- `duals`: opposite/dual categories. Axiomatised in a different way from McLarty to  fit into the logic better (Theorem 18-19).
- `discrete`: Discrete categories (Theorem 20-23).
- `Pb_def`: construct the function symbols Pbo, Pba1 and Pba2 using specification rule. 
- `Icat_def`: definition of internal category according to MacLane's "Categories for working mathematician".
- `Thm24`: Theorem 24.
- `isio_def`: use the predicate "isio" to give `semantical` version of the diagrams in the definition of internal category and internal functors.
- `ISC`: Internal small category (Theorem 25-26).
